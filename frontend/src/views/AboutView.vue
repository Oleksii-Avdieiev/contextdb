    <h1>About ContextDB</h1>
    <p>ContextDB is an application designed to assist large language models (LLMs) by providing them with up-to-date context on various tools and frameworks such as React, FastAPI, Vue.js, and more. This enables LLMs to stay informed about the latest developments in these technologies, making them more effective in generating accurate and relevant responses.</p>
    <p>The platform offers an easy-to-use interface for downloading documentation, as well as an API for integration into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications, enhancing their capabilities by providing them with the necessary context directly.</p>
